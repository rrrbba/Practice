# Here's the code for an Element, which will be a single unit in a linked list:

class Element(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
# Make sure you understand this code before moving on! We use __init__ to initialize a new Element. An Element has some value associated with it (which could be anything—a number, a string, a character, et cetera), and it has a variable that points to the next element in the linked list.

# Now, let's set up a LinkedList class:

class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
# This code is very similar—we're just establishing that a LinkedList is something that has a head Element, which is the first element in the list. If we establish a new LinkedList without a head, it will default to None.

# Great! Let's add a method to our LinkedList to make it a little more useful. This method will add a new Element to the end of our LinkedList.

    def append(self, new_element):
        current = self.head
        if self.head:
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_element
        else:
            self.head = new_element
# Again, this part is really important, so don't rush through it. Take the code line-by-line and make sure everything makes sense. If the LinkedList already has a head, iterate through the next reference in every Element until you reach the end of the list. Set next for the end of the list to be the new_element. Alternatively, if there is no head already, you should just assign new_element to it and do nothing else.
